## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- FFmpeg (automatically installed on most platforms)
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

Using yarn:
```bash
yarn global add @shipworthy/video-to-shorts
```

Or using pnpm:
```bash
pnpm add -g @shipworthy/video-to-shorts
```

### Quick Start

Checkout the [CLI documentation](packages/cli/README.md) for more detailed usage instructions and options.

Process a directory of videos or a single video:

```bash
# Process a directory
video-to-shorts /path/to/videos

# Process a single video
video-to-shorts /path/to/video.mp4
```

### Advanced Usage

Checkout the [CLI documentation](packages/cli/README.md) for more detailed usage instructions and options.

```bash
# Process videos with debug logging
video-to-shorts ./videos --debug

# Process 2 videos concurrently (max: number of CPU cores)
video-to-shorts ./videos -j 2

# Analyze every 60th frame, 3 frames in parallel
video-to-shorts ./videos -f 60 -p 3

# Process specific portion of videos
video-to-shorts ./videos -s 00:30 -e 02:00

# Specify custom output directory
video-to-shorts ./videos -o ./shorts

# Process a video with start/end times in filename
video-to-shorts ./00:00:30-00:02:00.mp4
```

### Configuration

The analyzer configuration can be provided in two ways:

1. As a JSON file (`video-to-shorts.json`):
```json
{
  "keep": "Content is interesting, important, or high quality",
  "remove": "Content is unwanted, irrelevant, or of poor quality",
  "speedUp": "Content is repetitive, slow, or less interesting but still relevant",
  "confidenceThreshold": 0.7,
  "openaiApiKey": "your-api-key"  // Optional, can also be set via environment variable or CLI flag
}
```

2. As a JSON string directly in the command line:
```bash
video-to-shorts ./videos -c '{"keep": "Content is engaging", "confidenceThreshold": 0.8}'
```

For more detailed usage instructions and options, see the [CLI documentation](packages/cli/README.md).
